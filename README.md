# pricing-engine
A play project to allow me to experiment with Gradle, Kotlin, Spring Boot and Sqlite.
This may be of some use to function as a restful service for my [Java 8 Experiments](https://github.com/PhilOfCalth/Java8Experiments) to hit

## Running the App
In gradle
```
gradle clean bootRun
```
